# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

AI Page Summarizer takes security and privacy seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Privacy-First Design
- **Local API Key Storage**: API keys are stored locally in your browser only
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal data
- **Direct API Communication**: Extension communicates directly with AI providers
- **No Third-Party Servers**: No intermediary servers process your content
- **Content Not Stored**: Webpage content is processed in real-time and not retained

### Data Protection
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use encrypted HTTPS connections
- **Minimal Permissions**: Extension requests only necessary permissions
- **Content Script Isolation**: Content extraction doesn't modify original pages
- **Secure Storage**: Uses Chrome's secure storage APIs

### API Security
- **Key Validation**: API keys are validated before use
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects AI provider rate limits
- **Timeout Protection**: Requests have appropriate timeouts

## üîç Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No              |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email us directly** at: [security@yourproject.com] (replace with actual email)
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow reasonable time** for us to respond and fix the issue

### What to Include
Please provide as much information as possible:
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Security
- **Keep API keys private**: Never share your API keys
- **Use separate keys**: Don't reuse API keys across applications
- **Monitor usage**: Check your AI provider dashboards regularly
- **Rotate keys**: Periodically generate new API keys
- **Set spending limits**: Configure usage limits in your AI provider accounts

### Browser Security
- **Keep Chrome updated**: Use the latest Chrome version
- **Review permissions**: Understand what permissions the extension needs
- **Use HTTPS sites**: Prefer secure websites when possible
- **Regular security scans**: Keep your system secure

### Extension Security
- **Download from official sources**: Only install from Chrome Web Store or GitHub
- **Verify checksums**: Check file integrity if installing manually
- **Review code**: The extension is open source - review the code
- **Report suspicious behavior**: Contact us if something seems wrong

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Measures in Code

### Input Validation
- **Content sanitization**: Webpage content is cleaned before processing
- **API key validation**: Keys are validated for correct format
- **URL validation**: Only allowed API endpoints are accessed
- **Length limits**: Content is limited to prevent abuse

### Error Handling
- **No sensitive data in logs**: API keys and personal data are not logged
- **Generic error messages**: Detailed errors are not exposed to users
- **Graceful degradation**: Extension continues working despite errors
- **Timeout handling**: Prevents hanging requests

### Permissions
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary Chrome permissions
- **Host permissions**: Limited to required AI provider domains
- **Content script restrictions**: Limited access to webpage content
- **Storage isolation**: Extension data is isolated from websites

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Update Process
1. **Security patches** are prioritized and released quickly
2. **Users are notified** through Chrome's automatic update system
3. **Release notes** include security fix information (without details)
4. **Public disclosure** happens after users have had time to update

### Staying Informed
- **Watch the repository** for security updates
- **Enable automatic updates** in Chrome
- **Check release notes** for security information
- **Follow security advisories** if we publish them

## üß™ Security Testing

### Regular Testing
- **Code reviews** for all changes
- **Dependency scanning** for vulnerable packages
- **Permission audits** to ensure minimal access
- **API security testing** with various inputs

### Community Testing
- **Bug bounty program**: Considering implementation
- **Security researchers**: Welcome responsible disclosure
- **Code audits**: Open source allows community review
- **Penetration testing**: Periodic security assessments
