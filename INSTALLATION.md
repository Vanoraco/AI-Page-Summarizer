- **Content length**: Works with both short and long articles
- **Languages**: Primarily optimized for English content

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- **Check file structure**: Make sure `manifest.json` is in the root folder
- **Add icons**: The extension requires icon files to load properly
- **Check Chrome version**: Requires Chrome 88+ for Manifest V3 support

### Context Menu Not Appearing
- **Refresh the page** after installing the extension
- **Check extension is enabled** in `chrome://extensions/`
- **Try a different website** - some sites may block extensions

### API Errors
- **"API key not configured"**: Add your API key in settings
- **"Invalid API key"**: Check your key is correct and has billing enabled
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes and try again
- **"Connection failed"**: Check your internet connection

### Content Extraction Issues
- **"Unable to extract content"**: The page may not have enough text
- **Poor quality summaries**: Try on pages with more structured content
- **Missing content**: Some websites may block content extraction

## Security Notes

### Your Data is Safe
- **API keys stored locally** in your browser only
- **No data sent to our servers** - direct communication with AI providers
- **Content not stored** - processed in real-time only
- **HTTPS encryption** for all API communications

### Best Practices
- **Keep API keys private** - don't share them
- **Monitor usage** through your AI provider's dashboard
- **Set spending limits** in your AI provider account
- **Disable extension** on sensitive websites if concerned
